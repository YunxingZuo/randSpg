# Anything to the right of a hash is a comment

# Composition is set by atomic symbols followed by number as such:
composition            = Mg4Al2

# Which spacegroups to generate are set as follows (hyphens and commas work)
spacegroups            = 1-8, 10, 25, 28, 30-32

# lattice mins and maxes set constraints on the lattice to be generated.
# Distances are in Angstroms and angles are in degrees.
#                           a,    b,    c, alpha,  beta, gamma
latticeMins            =  3.0,  3.0,  3.0,  60.0,  60.0,  60.0
latticeMaxes           = 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 120.0, 120.0, 120.0

# minVolume and maxVolume specify constraints on the volume in Angstroms
# If the volume is not within this range, it will be rescaled so that it is
# If you remove minVolume or specify it to be -1, there will be no minVolume
# Same goes for maxVolume
minVolume              = 450
maxVolume              = 500

# numOfEachSpgToGenerate tells us how many crystals of each spg to generate
numOfEachSpgToGenerate = 3

# For advanced users: by default, the program will only generate a spacegroup
# for a crystal if it can use the most general Wyckoff position at least
# once. This is because the spacegroup is not guaranteed if the most
# general Wyckoff position is not used at least once. The user, however,
# may turn off that option here by setting it to false.
# If this is the case, more compositions may be generated for a particular
# spacegroup, but they may not be the correct spacegroup (about a 50 or 60%
# chance overall - but it differs with each spacegroup)

#forceMostGeneralWyckPos = false

# For advanced users: this allows us to force an element to be assigned
# to a specific Wyckoff position. If you wish to force an element to be in
# the same Wyckoff position multiple times, just repeat the tag multiple times
# i. e. add 'forceWyckPos Mg = a' on as many lines as you want to force the
# Wyckoff position

#forceWyckPos Mg        = a

# We can set minimum radii (Angstroms) for individual atoms

#setRadius Ti           = 0.5

# Or for all atoms. A min radius for an individual atom trumps this one
# If the default min radius of the atom is less than this input value, then
# the min radius of that atom is set to be this value
# Value is in Angstroms
setMinRadii            = 0.3

# This scaling factor will scale all radii that were not explicity set
# The new radii are equal to (radius * scalingFactor)
# This is particularly useful when changing the pressure of a crystal
scalingFactor          = 0.5

# This sets the maximum number of attempts to generate any given spacegroup
maxAttempts            = 100

# This sets the output directory
outputDir              = temp

# Verbosity indicates how much output to generate in the log file
# 'n' is no output, 'r' is regular output, and 'v' is verbose output
verbosity              = r

# In the output POSCAR, the name is <composition>_<spg>-<index>
