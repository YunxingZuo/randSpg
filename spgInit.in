# Composition is set by atomic symbols followed by number as such:
composition            = Mg3Al2Si3O12

# Which spacegroups to generate are set as follows (hyphens and commas work)
spacegroups            = 1-3, 5, 7, 14-19

# lattice mins and maxes set constraints on the lattice to be generated.
# Distances are in Angstroms and angles are in degrees.
#                           a,    b,    c, alpha,  beta, gamma
latticeMins            =  3.0,  3.0,  3.0,  60.0,  60.0,  60.0
latticeMaxes           = 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 120.0, 120.0, 120.0

# numOfEachSpgToGenerate tells us how many crystals of each spg to generate
numOfEachSpgToGenerate = 2

# We can set minimum radii (Angstroms) for individual atoms
setMinRadius Ti        = 0.5

# Or for all atoms. A min radius for an individual atom trumps this one
# If the default min radius of the atom is less than this input value, then
# the min radius of that atom is set to be this value
# Value is in Angstroms
setMinRadii            = 0.3

# This scaling factor will scale all min radii that were not explicity set
# The new min radii are equal to (minRadii * scalingFactor)
# This is particularly useful when changing the pressure of a crystal
scalingFactor          = 0.5

# This sets the maximum number of attempts to generate any given spacegroup
maxAttempts            = 100

# Verbosity indicates how much output to generate in the log file
# 'n' is no output, 'r' is regular output, and 'v' is verbose output
verbosity              = r

# In the output POSCAR, the name is <composition>_<spg>_<number>
