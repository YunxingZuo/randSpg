# Composition is set by atomic symbols followed by number as such:

# Which spacegroups to generate are set as follows (hyphens and commas work)

# lattice mins and maxes set constraints on the lattice to be generated.
# Distances are in Angstroms and angles are in degrees.
#                           a,    b,    c, alpha,  beta, gamma
