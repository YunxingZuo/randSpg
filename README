**** UNIX COMPILATION ****

In order to compile, one simply needs cmake and a c++11 compiler.

For ubuntu, you may install cmake by entering "sudo apt-get install cmake"

Compilation instructions:

Enter the following into a terminal from the root spgGen directory

  mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make -j3

The program should be compiled!

To run the program, use the executable that is created in the build directory
as follows:
  ./spgGen <inputFileName>

A sample input file with instructions is included in the root
directory: spgGen.in. You may copy it to the build directory and then run

  ./spgGen spgGen.in

For the sample input file, the results are stored in a directory called "temp",
and log information is stored in "spgGen.log". Check them out!

The results are stored as POSAR files. If you wish to convert them to another
file format, you may want to look into OpenBabel.



**** WINDOWS MSVC COMPILATION ****

In order to compile with Windows, one needs cmake and MSVC 2013 or greater
(other Windows compilers may work as well, but the CMakeLists.txt or
code may need to be adjusted a little bit)

You will then need to open an MSVC command prompt (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21476588/where-is-developer-command-prompt-for-vs2013
for an example of how to do this). The MSVC command prompt has all of the
environments set up like we need to be.

From the MSVC command prompt, find the spgGen root directory, and then
type the following commands in the prompt:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"
  nmake

If all goes well, your spgGen.exe file should now be present in the directory!

To run the program, use the executable that is created in the build directory
as follows:
  spgGen.exe <inputFileName>

A sample input file with instructions is included in the root
directory: spgGen.in. You may copy it to the build directory and then run

  spgGen.exe spgGen.in

For the sample input file, the results are stored in a directory called "temp",
and log information is stored in "spgGen.log". Check them out!

The results are stored as POSAR files. If you wish to convert them to another
file format, you may want to look into OpenBabel.
