In order to compile, one simply needs cmake and a c++11 compiler.

For ubuntu, you may install cmake by entering "sudo apt-get install cmake"

Compilation instructions:

Enter the following into a terminal from the root spgInit directory

  mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make -j3

The program should be compiled!

To run the program, use the executable that is created in the build directory
as follows:
  ./spgInit <inputFileName>

A sample input file with instructions is included in the root
directory: spgInit.in
